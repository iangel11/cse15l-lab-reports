# Lab3 Report
Lab 3 was indeed an interesting experience that allowed me to practice the basic concepts of using terminal commands. 
Throughout the lab session, I used commands such as `cd`, `ls`, and `cat`. Here's my report on them!

* **cd:** Changes directory.
* **ls:** Lists the contents of a directory.
* **cat:** Displays the contents of a file.


### `cd`:
#### 1. Using the command with no arguments
While running this command, the absolute path was: `/Users/ianangel`
